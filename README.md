I designed and developed the website for the 2024 Viz Industry Fair (VIF), which is an annual Texas A&M event aimed at guiding students toward successful careers.
Over the course of the school year, it offers portfolio reviews, mock interviews, professionalism workshops, talks and presentations, and fair daysâ€”ALL involving industry professionals.
The official website is https://vizindustryfair.com/. However, since I (or anyone in the future) will eventually update the site again, I am also hosting the 2024 version of the site
at https://vizindustryfair-wip.netlify.app/.

I have been part of the VIF committee since Fall 2021, when I first volunteered to build the website for the 2022 fair (https://github.com/NkemdiAnyiam/VIF-2022-Site). I love coding/designing as well as finding opportunities to help other students in general, so being able to build these sites from scratch and help with such a huge event is something I am very proud of.
